## Architecture

The library follows Atomic Design principles with the following structure:

```
src/
  ├── atomic/
  │   ├── atoms/       # Basic building blocks
  │   ├── molecules/   # Combinations of atoms (e.g., TabView)
  │   ├── organisms/   # Complex components (e.g., Modal)
  │   └── biomes/      # Flow components and features
  ├── constants/
  │   ├── colors/      # Color definitions and palettes
  │   ├── typography/  # Typography rules and styles
  │   ├── breakpoints/ # Responsive breakpoints
  │   └── icons/       # Icon components
  ├── themes/          # Theme definitions
  └── fonts/          # Font assets
```

### Design System

#### Colors

The library implements a comprehensive color system with semantic colors:

-   **Primary**: Supernova (Yellow) - Brand accent color
-   **Secondary**: Mako (Black) - Primary text and borders
-   **Ash**: Light backgrounds and contrast elements
-   **Live Blue**: Used for live events and secondary actions
-   **Success**: Confirmation and success states
-   **Error**: Error states and required fields
-   **Orange**: Additional accent color

Each color includes a full range of variations (50-950).

#### Typography

Three main font families are used:

-   **Kapra Neue Pro**: Headers and display text
-   **Pitch Sans Medium**: Titles and subheadings
-   **Rubik**: Body text and general content

Font sizes are standardized across different text styles:

-   Headers: 2XL (3.75rem) to Tiny (1rem)
-   Titles: L (1.25rem) to XS (0.75rem)
-   Body: L (1.125rem) to XXS (10px)

#### Breakpoints

```
xs: 0 - 576px    (Mobile)
sm: 576 - 767px  (Mobile)
md: 768 - 991px  (Tablet)
lg: 1024 - 1199px (Desktop)
xl: 1200px+      (Large Desktop)
